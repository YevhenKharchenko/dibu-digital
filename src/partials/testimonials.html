            The "We Tried Everything" Brand
          </p>
          <p class="testimonials-slide-text">
            A local e-commerce store had spent thousands on Facebook and Google
            ads with no significant returns. They came to us with frustration
            and skepticism. After auditing their campaigns, we found the
            problem: their targeting was way off. Within three months of working
            with us, their ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) increased by 400%, and
            their monthly revenue doubled.

          <p class="testimonials-slide-subtitle">The "SEO Nightmare" Company</p>
          <p class="testimonials-slide-text">
            A tech startup invested heavily in SEO, yet their website traffic
            was stagnant. They were stuck in an outdated keyword strategy,
            over-relying on long-form articles that nobody read. We restructured
            their content, implemented AI-driven search intent optimization, and
            within six months, they saw a 5X increase in organic traffic.

            The "Social Media Struggle" Business
          </p>
          <p class="testimonials-slide-text">
            A beauty brand was active on every social platform but had no
            engagement. They followed every trend, yet their audience wasn’t
            growing. We introduced them to a simplified yet powerful content
            strategy focused on authenticity and storytelling. Within a year,
            their Instagram following grew by 300%, and engagement rates
            tripled.
